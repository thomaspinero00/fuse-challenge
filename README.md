## Fuse take home

The goal of this challenge is to develop a `backend service` for stock trading operations. The service should integrate with a mock vendor API (provided by Fuse) to:

1. List available stocks
2. Get user portfolios (list of their stocks and quantities)
3. Execute stock purchase transactions
4. Generate and send by email daily reports including successful and failed transactions

** Only these 3 endpoints are required and the daily email report process ( NOT user management endpoints like GET/UPDATE/DELETE users are required, neither LIST of transactions ) - Any endpoint outside of these 3, are not taking in consideration. **

## Requirements

- The service should be written in Node.js ( any framework is allowed )
- The service has to run locally and should be able to be started in simple steps ( if it doesn't run, it doesn't pass the challenge )
- Feel free to create and use any kind of architecture / db / infrastructure you want

## Considerations

- The stock vendor changes the stock price every 5 minutes
- The stock vendor is not reliable 100% all the time

## Deliverables

- Think this is a real project, so you should deliver a production-ready service
- The source code of the service in `private repository`, add the user `@skaznowiecki` / `@sebastian-alvarez-fuse-finance` / `@danielruizr` / `@said-fuse` as a collaborator
- A `README.md` file with instructions on how to run the service and any other information you think is relevant
- A `REPORT.md` file with a description of the architecture and the decisions you made
- Clean commits with clear messages

## Vendor API Endpoints

Fuse provides a mock API for you to use in this challenge. The API has two endpoints:

### Base URL

`https://api.challenge.fusefinance.com`

### API-KEY

You should add the `x-api-key` header with the value `nSbPbFJfe95BFZufiDwF32UhqZLEVQ5K4wdtJI2e`

### GET /stocks

The endpoint should return a list of stocks from the vendor and nextToken to get the next page. To get the next page, you should add the `nextToken` as a query parameter.

```
{
    "status": 200,
    "data": {
        "items": [
         ...stock data
        ],
         "nextToken": "string"
    }
}
```

### POST /stocks/:symbol/buy

The request should have the following body:

```
{
    "price": 220.67,
    "quantity": 1
}
```

You get the stock price from the previous endpoint, if the price is more/less than 2% from the current stock price, the transaction will fail.

For example:

- If the stock price is 100, and the user tries to buy it for 95, the transaction should fail because it's more than 2% of the stock price
- If the stock price is 100, and the user tries to buy it for 98.5, the transaction should succeed because it's less than 2% of the stock price

## Bonus

- Deploy the service in a cloud provider is a plus ( not required )

Enjoy the challenge! 🚀
